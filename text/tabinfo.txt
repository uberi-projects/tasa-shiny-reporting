By using standardized data templates, we can ensure that all data fed into the app will be processed as intended. Using non-standardized data could result in inaccurate analyses, app crashes, or corrupted report files. Therefore, we strongly recommend all users ensure their data adheres to the provided templates. Use the table below to find the data template and metadata that matches your data type.
You may have to create a copy of your data with some minor changes before feeding the data into the app. For example, if the template calls for a variable to be in meters, but you used feet, you will need to preconvert the column to match. Ensure that the structure, data content, and units of measurement (e.g., feet vs meters) adheres to the template. A detailed metadata is available within each template as well, with a description of each variable, including definition, units of measurement, and rules such as ‘Must be an integer,’ or ‘Must be formatted YYYY-MM-DD.’
Please note that Catch data is a special case. While Catch data have provided templates and metadata, the app is designed to take data directly from SMART exports, as the data were collected in a prestandardized way. Therefore, if you have data that came directly from SMART, it should already standardized, unless the custom SMART package has since deviated. This notice is being posted April 2025.
