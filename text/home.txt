Thank you for accessing the Turneffe Reef-Monitoring Data Reporting Tool. This tool is intended for use by Turneffe Atoll Sustainability Association (TASA) authorized staff to create standard reports from reef monitoring data. Use of this tool will improve the efficiency of the ‘data to reporting’ pipeline for TASA, allowing reports to be released promptly after data collection. 
Creation of this app was made possible by funding from _______. The app software owner is TASA, and the lead software developer is Jess Boles, Data Scientist, UB-ERI. Please direct questions about the codebase to Jess Boles, jessica.boles@ub.edu.bz. If you notice any errors or issues with the app, please submit a bug report using the Submit Bug Report button.
To use this app, first users should identify the data they would like to report on. The data should include  1 or more datafiles for a specific reef monitoring datatype, either fisheries catch, long-term atoll monitoring program (LAMP), or spawning aggregations (SPAG). Each datafile should be appropriately formatted according to the standardized template for that datatype. Templates may be viewed in the Data Templates page for reference. 
Once the datafiles are prepared, they should be uploaded on the corresponding Create Reports page for that datatype. A blue progress bar should indicate if the upload is successful. Users should then press the Validate Data button to perform a data validation operation on the upload. If the validation passes, the .docx report may be generated by entering any required inputs in the righthand content box, and pressing Generate Report. 
For additional information on using and maintaining this app, please visit the Manual page.
