# Turneffe Atoll Queen Conch LAMP Dataset Report: `r study_year`

**Date Generated:** `r format(Sys.time(), '%Y-%m-%d')` \
**Source Data:** `r datafiles` \

Coral reefs are biodiversity hotspots that provide critical habitats for diverse species, support coastal communities, and offer economic opportunities through the harvest of marine invertebrates and fish. 
Monitoring these ecosystems is essential to assess health, function, and changes over time, informing management decisions. 
This report presents findings from monitoring surveys of queen conch (_Aliger gigas_) at Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve (TAMR) from `r study_year`. 
Data on conch abundance and shell measurements were collected by TASA staff and collaborators as part of the Long-term Atoll Monitoring Program (LAMP), which tracks key taxa at the atoll through standardized surveys. 
This report aims to summarize and visualize the queen conch dataset from `r study_year` to facilitate data interpretation and support management decisions by TASA staff, collaborators, and stakeholders.\


## Background

### Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve

Turneffe Atoll is the largest atoll in Belize, spanning mangrove and littoral forest cayes, seagrass beds, and coral reef ecosystems (Stoddart, 1962). 
It features an inner lagoon as well as an outer reef that encircles the atoll. 
The Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve (TAMR), which encompasses the entire atoll, covers 1,471 km² and includes multiple management zones, such as general use, conservation, preservation, and spawning aggregation zones, as well as special management areas. 
TAMR plays a valuable role in supporting biodiversity and sustaining the communities that depend on its resources. 
Its reef provides coastal protection from extreme weather events (Fedler, 2011), serves as a habitat for diverse marine species, and supports economic activities such as commercial and recreational fishing, guided diving, and tourism.\


### Long-term Atoll Monitoring Program

The Long-term Atoll Monitoring Program (LAMP) at TAMR, adapted from the original LAMP protocol for Glover’s Reef (Acosta 2004), is designed to monitor key fished taxa at the atoll over space and time, including finfish, queen conch (_Aliger gigas_) and milk conch (_Strombus costatus_), Caribbean spiny lobster (_Panulirus argus_) and spotted spiny lobster (_Panulirus guttatus_), black sea urchins (_Diadema antillarum_), and Caribbean king crab (_Mithrax spinosissumus_). 
The program uses habitat sampling to estimate population sizes and physical characteristics of these taxa, enabling spatial and temporal comparison.

LAMP's primary objectives are to assess the viability of these populations by identifying trends in abundance, reproduction, physical characteristics, and habitat quality where applicable. 
Data collected through LAMP facilitates evaluation of management zone effectiveness. 
The program data also supports recommendations on enforcement, monitoring, education, outreach, fishing quotas, season lengths, size limits, and other government regulations to ensure the long-term sustainability of the fishery, all while preserving the natural beauty and ecological value of the atoll.

The queen conch dataset is a key component of the overall LAMP data, notable for its extensive historical record and the breadth of information collected. 
Queen conch is a commercially significant species within the TAMR. 
As outlined in the Turneffe Atoll Management Plan, regular population monitoring is required to support sustainable management and conservation efforts. 
In 2013, Zale et al. developed a methodology based on Acosta’s LAMP protocol (2004) to monitor queen conch at TAMR, which was later reused in 2016 and 2017 to assess changes in the stock over time and improve the monitoring methodology (Zale et al. 2016, Zale et al. 2018). 
From 2023 onward, these datasets are integrated into the broader LAMP program data, which includes crab, lobster, urchins, and finfish, to enhance the program. 
Data from monitoring surveys of queen conch at TAMR include conch abundance, depth of individuals, and shell measurements (lip thickness and shell length).\


### Queen Conch

Queen conch (_Aliger gigas_) are large-sized Caribbean gastropods characterized by their distinctive whorl-shaped shell with a set of thick spines at the apex. 
Juvenile queen conch have a pink, pearly interior, and the shell has a recognizable dark periostracum layer. 
Sex is determined by the presence of either a verge or egg groove inside the shell, which can only be observed by removing the conch from its shell. 
Reproduction occurs during warmer months (Appeldoorn and Baker 2013). 
`r samba_definition`

In Belize, the queen conch fishery is the second most important commercial fishery in the country. 
Conch are harvested by free diving depths of 5-60ft in seagrass beds and coral reef habitats. 
The fishery is regulated by the Belize Fisheries Department (BFD). 
National regulations mandate that conch may only be harvested if they exceed a shell length of 7 inches, and only during the open season, which extends from October 1st until June 30th of the following year, or until the national conch quota is reached, whichever occurs first. 
The use of SCUBA for commercial conch harvesting is strictly prohibited. 
Additionally, commercial fishing activities in Belize require a fishing license (Belize Fisheries Department accessed 2025).

According to NOAA, queen conch density needs to be at least 100 conch per hectare to facilitate proper mating (NOAA Fisheries 2025).\


## Methods

Survey sites were selected as representative nearshore habitat types (as defined by Mumby and Harborne, 1999) known to be inhabited by Queen Conch based on prior assessments (Zale et al., 2016). 
Each site is assigned a unique ID and decimal coordinates to facilitate resampling in future years. 
When a site is re-sampled, habitat classification is reevaluated for the corresponding sampling period. 
Additionally, each site is categorized within a specific section of TAMR, either North, Northeast, Southeast, or Southwest (Figure 1).

The survey periods for this report’s dataset extend from `r study_period` at TAMR. 
Sampling for queen conch LAMP is ideally done during summer before harvest. 
`r number_sites1` sites were sampled in `r study1_year`, and `r number_sites2` were sampled in `r study2_year`, 
including `r number_sites` unique sites, and `r number_sites_common` common to the `r study_years_count` sampled years. 
At each site, four 50m by 4m belt transects were surveyed by data collectors either diving, snorkeling, or wading depending on the depth. 
Transects were placed parallel to each other 10m apart and parallel to wind direction where possible. 
Each transect line was established using one white 3/16” non-stretchable sinking Dacron rope, which was pulled taut and anchored at either end with buoy lines on each anchor extended to the surface for retrieval. 
The belt transect included 2m of space on either side of the line.

During sampling, two data collectors swam together down either side of each transect approximately 1.5m above the substrate. 
In sites shallower than 1.5m in depth, data collectors instead snorkeled, and in sites less than 0.25m in depth, data collectors waded. 
The data collectors counted all living queen conch within 2m of the line on their side of the belt. 
Queen conch close to 2m from the line were also counted, and their distance from the line recorded. 
Shell lengths and lip thickness of queen conch were measured during sampling using calipers, as well as depth of capture to the nearest foot using a dive computer. 
Lip thickness was measured only in lipped individuals, and was measured as 4cm inward from the edge of the middle third of the lip, where the lip is relatively straight instead of wavy. 
After being measured, all queen conch were returned upright to their original position of capture.

This report, including text, figures, and tables, was generated using the Turneffe Reef-Monitoring Data Reporting Tool (TASA 2025), an R Shiny app which takes standardized reef monitoring data, validates the dataset, and creates a shareable output. \

## Conclusion

By summarizing and visualizing the queen conch LAMP survey data from `r study_year`, researchers, policy-makers, and other stakeholders are better able to interpret and use the dataset. 
This report supports the aims of the Long-term Atoll Monitoring Program by offering a more understandable view of the data itself, supporting future efforts to create recommendations on enforcement, monitoring, education, outreach, and regulations to ensure the long-term sustainability of the TAMR fishery while safeguarding the ecological value of the atoll.\
