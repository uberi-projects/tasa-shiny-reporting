Coral reef ecosystems, like those of Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve (TAMR), provide key ecological and economic value to coastal families. 
With proper management and monitoring, 
these ecosystems can continue to support people sustainably in the long-term. 
Directly tracking the activities and harvests of local fishers is a key method for monitoring coral reefs, 
as it offers insights into ecosystem dynamics and possible pressures. 
This report presents `r tolower(timeframe)` findings from fishery-dependent monitoring of Caribbean spiny 
lobster (*Panulirus argus*) at Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve (TAMR) from `r study_timeframe`. 
Data were recorded by TASA patrolling officers in direct communication with TAMR fishers during their fishing trips. 
Data were collected on key economic species. 
This report aims to summarize and visualize the Fisheries 
Lobster Catch dataset from `r study_timeframe` to facilitate data interpretation and strengthen the scientific basis for 
management decisions by TASA staff, collaborators, and stakeholders.\


## Background

### Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve

Turneffe Atoll is the largest atoll in Belize, spanning mangrove and littoral forest cayes, seagrass beds, and coral reef ecosystems (Stoddart, 1962). 
It features an inner lagoon as well as an outer reef that encircles the atoll. 
The Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve (TAMR), which encompasses the entire atoll, covers 1,471 km² and includes multiple management zones, such as general use, conservation, preservation, and spawning aggregation zones, as well as special management areas. 
TAMR plays a valuable role in supporting biodiversity and sustaining the communities that depend on its resources. 
Its reef provides coastal protection from extreme weather events (Fedler, 2011), serves as a habitat for diverse marine species, and supports economic activities such as commercial and recreational fishing, guided diving, and tourism.\
