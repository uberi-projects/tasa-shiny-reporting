## Background

### Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve

Turneffe Atoll is the largest atoll in Belize, encompassing mangrove and littoral forest cayes, seagrass beds, and extensive coral reef ecosystems (Stoddart, 1962). 
It features an inner lagoon and a surrounding barrier reef that defines the atoll structure. 
The Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve (TAMR), which spans the entire atoll covers 1,471 km², and is divided into several management zones, 
including general use, conservation, preservation, spawning aggregation sites, and special management areas. 
TAMR plays a critical role in conserving biodiversity and sustaining the livelihoods of communities that rely on its resources. 
The reef system provides coastal protection from extreme weather events (Fedler, 2011), 
supports habitats for a wide range of marine species, and sustains key economic activities such as commercial and recreational fishing, SCUBA diving, and tourism.\

### Spawning Aggregations Monitoring

Monitoring spawning aggregations (SPAGs) at Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve is critically important for sustaining Belize’s reef fisheries and ensuring long-term 
ecosystem resilience. Turneffe hosts several historically significant aggregation sites, including Maugre Caye, Dog Flea Caye, and Caye Bokel, where key commercial 
species such as Nassau grouper, snappers, and jacks gather to reproduce. These events make populations especially vulnerable to overfishing, as past declines across 
Belize have shown that unchecked exploitation can collapse entire aggregations and diminish national fishery yields. Recent monitoring has demonstrated that robust, 
standardized surveys, including underwater counts, laser sizing, and acoustic monitoring, not only provide fishery-independent data on abundance, size structure, 
and spawning behavior but also strengthen Belize’s adaptive multispecies finfish management plan. By tracking population health and reproductive success over time, 
SPAG monitoring at Turneffe safeguards critical breeding grounds, supports food security and tourism, and ensures that management interventions are guided by science 
to prevent overexploitation and promote recovery of endangered species such as the Nassau grouper. 

Belize’s finfish management basket approach is a practical, ecosystem-based system that groups similar reef fish species into “management baskets” 
so they can be regulated collectively rather than through species-specific rules. Because Belize’s commercial finfish fishery is multispecies, 
with fishers catching a mix of snappers, groupers, jacks, grunts, and others on the same trip, the basket system streamlines management by 
applying shared regulations, such as size limits, seasonal closures, catch monitoring, and effort controls, to each group. Indicator species 
within each basket provide biological signals that guide adaptive decisions over time, including when to tighten or relax rules. Designed to be used 
alongside Belize’s broader adaptive finfish management plan, the basket approach makes enforcement more feasible, reduces species misreporting, and 
supports sustainability by managing ecological groups together rather than risking serial depletion of individual species.\
