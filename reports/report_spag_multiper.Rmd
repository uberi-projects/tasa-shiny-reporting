## Background

### Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve

Turneffe Atoll is the largest atoll in Belize, encompassing mangrove and littoral forest cayes, seagrass beds, and extensive coral reef ecosystems (Stoddart, 1962). 
It features an inner lagoon and a surrounding barrier reef that defines the atoll structure. 
The Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve (TAMR), which spans the entire atoll covers 1,471 km², and is divided into several management zones, 
including general use, conservation, preservation, spawning aggregation sites, and special management areas. 
TAMR plays a critical role in conserving biodiversity and sustaining the livelihoods of communities that rely on its resources. 
The reef system provides coastal protection from extreme weather events (Fedler, 2011), 
supports habitats for a wide range of marine species, and sustains key economic activities such as commercial and recreational fishing, SCUBA diving, and tourism.\
