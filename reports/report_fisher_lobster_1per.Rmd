# Turneffe Atoll Fisher Catch Lobster `r timeframe` Dataset Report: `r study_timeframe`

The marine resources and biodiversity abundant in coral reef ecosystems support the 
livelihoods of coastal communities, and provide economic opportunities that can be 
sustainable given attentive management and enforcement. 
Monitoring the activities and harvests of local fishers is important for 
understanding ecosystem productivity, assessing stock sustainability, 
and informing effective management decisions. 
This report presents `r tolower(timeframe)` findings from fishery-dependent monitoring of Caribbean spiny 
lobster (Panulirus argus) at Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve (TAMR) from `r study_timeframe`. 
Data were recorded directly by fishermen using SMART technology through a data collection 
package designed by TASA. This report aims to summarize and visualize the Fisher 
Lobster Catch dataset from `r study_timeframe` to facilitate data interpretation and support 
management decisions by TASA staff, collaborators, and stakeholders.\


## Background

### Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve

Turneffe Atoll is the largest atoll in Belize, spanning mangrove and littoral forest cayes, seagrass beds, and coral reef ecosystems (Stoddart, 1962). 
It features an inner lagoon as well as an outer reef that encircles the atoll. 
The Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve (TAMR), which encompasses the entire atoll, covers 1,471 km² and includes multiple management zones, such as general use, conservation, preservation, and spawning aggregation zones, as well as special management areas. 
TAMR plays a valuable role in supporting biodiversity and sustaining the communities that depend on its resources. 
Its reef provides coastal protection from extreme weather events (Fedler, 2011), serves as a habitat for diverse marine species, and supports economic activities such as commercial and recreational fishing, guided diving, and tourism.\

### Caribbean Spiny Lobsters

Caribbean spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) are brown-grey striped malacostracans, 
which can grow to around 60cm long, and have spines covering their shells instead of the 
large pinching claws of other lobsters (Holthuis, 1991). Spotted spiny lobster 
(Panulirus guttatus) are smaller than Caribbean spiny lobsters, with more distinct 
spots and shorter antennae. In Belize, the lobster fishery is the most important fishery 
in the country. Lobsters are caught using freediving and a hook stick, trapezoidal-shaped 
lobster traps placed in shallow sandy areas, or casitas (shade cloths) that act as a lure 
for lobsters which are then caught with a hook stick, snare, or a net bag (UNCTAD 2020). 
Regulations for Caribbean spiny lobster from the BFD include that no person shall fish 
moutling lobster or lobster with eggs, that fished lobster have minimum carapace length 
of 3-inches and minimum tail weight of 4-ounces, and that fishers adhere to the prescribed 
open season. Closed season is March 1st to June 30th for lobster (Belize Fisheries 
Department accessed 2025-b). Tar spots on female lobsters indicate recent mating, and 
females with eggs (‘berried’ females) indicate reproductive success. Monitoring sex ratio 
and presence of reproductive indicators is key for this species./


## Methods

Fisher catch data were collected at Turneffe Atoll 
Marine Reserve (TAMR) (Figure 1). 
The survey period for this report’s dataset extended 
from `r study_start` to `r study_end` at TAMR.

Fishermen were selected [process of selecting fishermen 
for the project]

Data on _____ were entered by fishermen using SMART 
technology through a data collection package 
designed by TASA. They [process of entering data by

This report, including text, figures, and tables, was generated using the 
Turneffe Reef-Monitoring Data Reporting Tool (TASA 2025), an R Shiny app which takes 
standardized reef monitoring data, validates the dataset, and creates a shareable output. \
